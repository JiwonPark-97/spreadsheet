# Comments to Evaluators:

I could not find a way to verify that an exception has been thrown (such as assert). Therefore, for invaild expression tests,
I simply commented in and out each line to make sure each invalid expression throws an exception. Currently, tests for
invaild expression are commented out.

I could not find how to enable VS spell checker on Mac. I checked thoroughly but there might be some typos.

# Assignment Specific Topics
Any additional feedback or write up required by the assignment.

Leave a space for a new paragraph.

Make sure you spell check your file (did you install the VS spell
checker?) and use your best writing ability.

# Consulted Peers:

I have not consulted with others since the instruction and algorithm were clear. Though I referred to the piazza posts.
