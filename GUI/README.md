# Partnership:

    I worked solo.

# Branching:

    All of my work is done under main branch.

# Additional Features and Design Decisions:
    
    

# Time Tracking (Personal Software Practice):

    I estimated that this assignment would take about 20 hours like the previous assignments. 
    However, understanding how GUI works (e.g. how .xaml file and .cs file are linked) took longer than I thought.
    Also, as there were much more egde cases than I expected, such as opening a new file causes the widget entry getting focused, handling exceptions and errors took longer than I expected.
    Additional features also took a long time as I faced many issues with what I wanted to implement, and eventually I changed the additional feature a couple times. 
    This assignmnet ended up taking about 35 hours.

# Best (Team) Practices:

    Write a paragraph about how assigning tasks help you keep focused (pun intended) on "task".  
    Write a second paragraph on best software practices that you employed to make your code better.

# Comments to Evaluators:
    
    When asking to save the data, I tried to call FileMenuSave method to avoid repeating code, but the next line was always excecuted before
    FileMenuSave finishes. Therefore, I decided to copy and paste FileMenuSave to FileMenuNew and FileMenuOpen.




    design decisions, external code resources, build guidelines, implementation notes, problems, etc.
