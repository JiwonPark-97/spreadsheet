# Partnership:

    I worked solo.

# Branching:

    All of my work is done under main branch.

# Additional Features and Design Decisions:
    
    I added a "sum" feature which adds up values on the entire row or column.
    User can enter either a lable of row (i.e. an int in range of 1-99) or a lable of column (i.e. A-Z)
    and click "calculate" button to get the result.


# Time Tracking (Personal Software Practice):

    I estimated that this assignment would take about 20 hours like the previous assignments. 
    However, understanding how MAUI works and handling edge cases took longer than I thought, and I ended up spending about 30 hours for this assignment.

# Best (Team) Practices:

    Write a paragraph about how assigning tasks help you keep focused (pun intended) on "task".  

    Assigning tasks on Github project helped me keep track of the requirements for this assignment.
    

    Write a second paragraph on best software practices that you employed to make your code better.

    I tried to avoid repeated code, make the code self explanatory 

# Comments to Evaluators:
    
    When asking to save the data, I tried to call FileMenuSave method to avoid repeating code, but the next line was always excecuted before
    FileMenuSave finishes. Therefore, I decided to copy and paste FileMenuSave to FileMenuNew and FileMenuOpen.
