# Comments to Evaluators:
    
    When asking to save the data, I tried to call FileMenuSave method, but the next line is always excecuted before
    FileMenuSave finishes. Therefore, I decided to copy and paste FileMenuSave to FileMenuNew and FileMenuOpen.




    design decisions, external code resources, build guidelines, implementation notes, problems, etc.
