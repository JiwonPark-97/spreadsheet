# Comments to Evaluators:

    ---------------- For Assignment 4 ------------------

    I tested every public method directly and private/protected method indirectly. To test protected methods,
    I added a new test class ProtectedMethodTests that inherits from Spreadsheet class.

    ---------------- For Assignment 5 ------------------

    For testing four-argument constructor, I used the example code in the instruction (on section 7) to create a file in the current directory.
    For the stress tests, I referred to the assignment4 grading test.
